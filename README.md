## <span style="background-color:#97CBEE">Random password and username generator using python ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„</span>

##### Please read the `README.md ` file carefully 
###### I am working on how can I make this code run on linux too. I am a beginner but surely I will write the script for that too
----
### <span style="background-color:#8FBC8F">General Information ðŸ˜ƒ</span>
- ##### Clone this repository to your local system using command prompt in administrative mode
- ##### Run this command is cmd to make a symbolic link to todo.bat `mklink generator generator.bat` 
- ##### If the link is created succesfully script can be run using .\generator
- ##### This script generate random passwords and random usernames :)
- ##### Two files known as `dog.jpg` and `cat.jpg` are important please do not delete those files
- ##### If you remove those files you will an error. I am working on how to deal with that error. Removal does not stop the execution #&7892 . It still works and generate passwords and usernames
- ##### If you run as  `path\to\script>.\generator.bat` first time it will make the files hidden as this is intended. Also it will make the two images `cat.jpg` & `dog.jpg` read-only. It's kind of small security I tried to add from my sideðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜….Those two images will not be hidden
- ##### To see the hidden files type in cmd
  #### ````path\to\script> attrib -h *````
   
   ###### Note:it is not recommended to show the files
- ##### Those two images are important cause these will store your passwords. The scrpits will store 10 passwords or usernames to those images. Passwords are stored in `dog.jpg` and `cat.jpg` contains your username. 
- ##### Your default image viewer will not be able to open this files. Now you know how to open files in another way,don't you?ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
- ##### Your command promt will only show you the one password or username ,but it actually generate 10 passwords or usernames at a time
- ##### To see those passwords open `dog.jpg` and for usernames open `cat.jpg`
- ##### These files are created in a way such that if the length of both files are more than 2kb they will be deleted and new files will be created. So if you get an error saying file not found (:(),it's okay  scripts still works well :)
